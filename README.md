# Mac Wi-Fi Reconnect

There seems to be an issue affecting some Macs (an early-2009 Mac mini in my
case) where the Wi-Fi will drop and will not attempt to reconnect to the
network â€“ only manually selecting the network will work again.

This is a simple AppleScript that checks if OS X / macOS has disconnected from
your Wi-Fi network and will attempt to reconnect after some time interval.
